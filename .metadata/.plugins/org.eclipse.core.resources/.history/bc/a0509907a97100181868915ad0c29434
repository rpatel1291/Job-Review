/**
 * Problem: Minimum Scalar Product
 * @author Ravi
 */
/*
 * Given two vectors v1 and v2 of equal length. The scalar product of the vectors is a single number produced by sum of the products x1y1 + ... + xnyn.
 * If you are allowed to permute the coordinates of each vector. What is the minimum possible scalar product.
 * 
 * Inputs:
 * 		T - # of test cases
 * 		N - # of coordinates in vector
 * 		v1 - list of coordinates for vector v1 => represented by array
 * 		v2 - list of coordinates for vector v2 => represented by array
 *    
 * Output:
 * 		Case # X : Y
 * 		where X is case number and Y is the resulting number
